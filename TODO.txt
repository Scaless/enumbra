BUG-CODEGEN: Sparse flags have wonky behavior that should be defined. 
    see: TestSparseFlags
    is_X functions should compare against valid flags only
BUG-CODEGEN: User-Default templates in user namespace may conflict if multiple files use the same namespace.
    Investigate moving/renaming/guard macro.

ENUMBRA: Move pre-condition checking to a function outside of generator to be able to re-use for other generators
ENUMBRA: Split cpp generator into more reasonable sections rather than one giant function.

BUILD: Update kEnumbraVersion with automatic numbers

CODEGEN: Add option for split compilation of Header and Implementation vs. Header-Only.
    output_implementation = header_only / header_and_implementation
    add/edit command line parameters: remove cppout, add cppouthpp/cppoutheader/cppoutimpl

CODEGEN: Add option for alignment/padding for strings to allow for SIMD lookups
CODEGEN: Support for generating and optimizing layouts for SIMD instructions

TEST: Set up a more robust testing framework
    Split test cases into more descriptive variants
    Add a config-generator to generate an enum with many values for stress testing

FEATURE: how to do name aliasing to allow multiple names for the same value?
    complicates {to/from}_string
    maybe require the user to specify which is the preferred name
FEATURE: improve warning/errors. Currently any tiny issue will immediately fail out of the process
    continue_on_error to get a list of all warnings/errors, but tool should NOT generate code if there are any

GITHUB: Set up actions for automating builds on several compilers (preferably: Windows/MSVC2022, Windows/Clang, Linux/GCC, Linux/Clang).
